# censor

A mobile-first PWA that censors photos with **blur** and **mosaic** — all
nondestructive, all on-device. No uploads, no server, no accounts.

**live: https://censor.lost.plus**

## features

- **box tool** — drag to draw a rectangular censor region
- **freehand tool** — scribble to censor arbitrary shapes (adjustable brush size)
- load an image with the file picker, drag it onto any screen, Cmd/Ctrl+V, or the clipboard button
- every censor is an **object**: tap it in move mode to select, drag to
  reposition, resize boxes from their corner handles, adjust its effect
  (mosaic / blur) and strength, or delete it
- creating a box or freehand censor returns to move mode automatically
- keyboard shortcuts: M = box, V = move, B = brush, [ / ] = effect strength
- undo and redo controls cover edits to censor objects
- opening a new image asks for confirmation when edit history would be lost
- closing or reloading the tab warns when edit history would be lost
- 32 hand-written, browser-selected language catalogs with per-message English fallback and RTL support
- strength is **per object**: mosaic = square cell size from 1×1 to 64×64 pixels,
  blur = radius in pixels
- pinch to zoom, two-finger / move-mode drag to pan
- copy or save the full-resolution result as a PNG (original stays untouched)
- installable (Add to Home Screen), works offline after first visit

## privacy

Images never leave the device. The whole app is static files; editing happens
entirely in canvas.

## develop

It's just static files — serve the directory over HTTP:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8600
```

## deploy

Hosted behind a Cloudflare Tunnel (`censor.lost.plus` → the server's
`localhost:8600`). Bump `CACHE` in `sw.js` when shipping changes so
installed copies pick up the update.
